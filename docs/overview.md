# Overview


There are two main groups of APIs in PrimeData. An *Application API* and an *Events Tracking API*.

**App API** is a RESTful-ish API that interfaces Prime's application resources, things like creating segments, execute a campaign, user management, permissions control, etc.

**[Tracking API](events-tracking)** is much more narrow in term of the functionality, its primary purpose is to collect and ingest events into Prime system.
