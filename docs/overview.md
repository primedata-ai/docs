# Overview


There are two main groups of APIs in PrimeData. An *Application API* and an *Events Tracking API*.

**Application API** is a RESTful-ish API that interface Prime's application resources, things like creating segments, execute a campaign, user management, permissions control, etc.

**[Event Tracking API](events-tracking)** is narrower on the functionality scope, its primary purpose is to collect and ingest events into the Prime system.
